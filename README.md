## Dotfiles

### Config for:

- Alacritty (terminal emulator)
- fish (shell)
- Starship (shell prompt)
- Neovim (editor)
- VS Code (editor)
- i3 (window manager)
- Zellij (terminal multiplexer)

### Additionally I use:

- riprep
- Kondo
- rewrk
- cargo-udeps
- fastmod
- cargo-edit
- cargo-expand
- cargo-binstall


### Scripts

- The `toggle-displays.sh` script is for toggling between external and internal displays in
i3 when using a laptop.

### Misc

- The .xbindkeysrc file is for taking snip-tool screenshots with `maim`, as well as enabling
the media keys on my keyboard when using a WM like i3. It relies on `xbindkeys` being
installed, and needs to be placed in $HOME.
