## Dotfiles

### Config for:

- Alacritty
- fish
- nvim
- LeftWM and eww bar (currently using i3 instead)
- i3

### Additionally I use:

- Kondo
- riprep
- Starship
- rewrk
- cargo-udeps

### Scripts

- The `toggle-displays.sh` script is for toggling between external and internal displays in
i3 when using a laptop. TODO: refine the script.

### Misc

- The .xbindkeysrc file is for taking snip-tool screenshots with `maim`, as well as enabling
the media keys on my keyboard when using a WM like i3/leftwm. It relies on `xbindkeys` being
installed.
